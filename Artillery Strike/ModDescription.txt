This mod adds 2 new, long-range attacks.

When you control a territory with a Cannon or Mortar (same icons as in Idle) you're able to use it every X amount of turns, or when you pay enough gold.

Cannons:
 - Single target!
 - The further the distance between the cannon and its target, the less damage it does (can be disabled)
 
Mortars:
 - Multi target!
 - Same as for the cannon but instead of just dealing less damage to the target it deals more damage to connected territories
