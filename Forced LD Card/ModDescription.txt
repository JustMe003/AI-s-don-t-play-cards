Forced LD (modded) card:

When this mod is in effect, play the Forced LD card on another player to force them to deploy locally (as per normal Local Deployment rules).

Description: The mod enforces the Local Deployment setting on the first turn of the game, then allows all players to deploy normally (freely) starting on turn 2.

You may not use this mod in a game with overlapping bonuses.

Warning: this mod can run into synching issues in a team game. If one player plays a card, then removes the order, the mod may still consider it unavailable for another player on the same team. Communicate with your teammates to avoid issues.
