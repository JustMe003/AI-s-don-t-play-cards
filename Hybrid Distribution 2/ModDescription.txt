Allows for some territories to be auto-distributed and some to be manual-distributed (picked) with more options.
- choose if territories in the distribution are auto-distributed or neutrals
- choose if auto-distributed territories have the same amount of armies as manual-distributed territories or as neutrals not in the distribution
- This mod overwrites wastelands, 'Hybrid Distribution' does not. This can lead to players having wastelands and thus more or less armies than their opponent
