This way you shouldn't have to wonder what happened when you watch a turn / history. They mostly use the GameOrderEvent for this, since this order can be anything they want. Just like other orders you can move them up and down in your order list before you submit your turn. \n\nNote that most orders added by mods are from a different order type, the GameOrderCustom type.

Requires that the game is a commerce game, and will do nothing otherwise. \n\nThe game creator can configure how expensive territories are to purchase, based on how many armies are on the neutral territory. To initiate a purchase, click the button for the mod on the menu, select the territory, and a purchase order will be inserted into your orders list. The purchase will complete when the turn advances.";
	mods["Buy Neutral"]["How to use"] = "This mod allows players to buy neutral territories with gold, the price of the territory is determined by the amount of armies and the multiplier configured by the game creator.\n\nThere are some things you should know before you start asking questions. The most notable thing you should know is that only territories you can fully see are purchasable. When playing with light or dense (also heavy) fog you will be able to see who owns the territory, but not the army count and which special units. The mod sees this as ânot fully visibleâ and these territories are not purchasable. To buy a territory in light, dense or heavy fog that is not fully visible, you should play a reconnaissance, surveillance or spy (only if youâre able to spy on neutral) card.\n\nSecond, when you add the order to buy a territory does not mean you will buy the territory for sure. When the turn advances, the mod will look at every purchase order and check if the territory is still neutral. If the territory is not neutral anymore at the time your purchase order gets processed, nothing will happen. Note that the purchase order type is GameOrderCustom, you can put these orders wherever you want in your order list. You can even put them before your deployment orders where they will get processed before any deployment orders, even those of your opponents.\n\nThird, the amount of armies on the neutral territory can differ at the time your purchase order gets processed then when you added the order in your order list. If the amount of armies on the territory is more than you originally paid for your purchase will get canceled. If the amount of armies is less than you originally paid for and the territory is still neutral, you will buy the territory but wonât get any compensation for paying too much.\n\nAt last, when playing on a big map, with a lot of neutral territories and no fog, the list where you can choose the territories from will be really, really big. Creating the list will take a while and searching for a precise territory is a task which requires a lot of patience. In this case I strongly recommend using the browser version to submit your turn. You can use [ctrl] + [F] to search for the name of the territory in the list which is way easier and faster than looking at every possible territory in the list. Note you cannot add these orders in the browser and finish creating your orders on mobile or in the app since the purchase orders will not be stored on the browser. The other way around is possible though.";
	mods["Buy Neutral"]["How to set up"] = "When you add this mod you have to make sure you enable commerce, otherwise the mod wonât do anything and players wonât be able to create purchase orders at all.\n\nAlso be careful with the multiplier. When you set the multiplier to high, buying neutrals will get extremely inefficiÃ«nt but setting it to low, it becomes extremely efficiÃ«nt. The bare minimum in my opinion is 1, although it is possible to set it to 0. But by doing so you will give players the possibility to buy every territory they can fully see for free, resulting in a massive auction where the players who know what is listed above (how to use) will get a massive advantage.";

If multi attack is bound to the reinforcement card youâll only be able to use multi attack if you played the reinforcement card. If it is bound to multiple cards (say spy card and gift card) youâll only have to play 1 of (either) those cards, not both to enable multi attack. Note that multi attack is only enabled for you if you played the card, if other players want to have multi attack they too have to play a card that enables it.\n\nIf you enable multi attack (or when it is always enabled) you still have to watch out for the limit of multi attacks. The mod keeps track of how many attacks armies have made so when they reach the limit the attacks are canceled, most of the time breaking your normal multi attack chain (an attack gets skipped, and all other attacks in the chain wonât go through since you donât own the attacking territory) and leads to confusion for most players.\n\nWhen the limit of multi attacks is not set to 0 (0 is infinite multi attacks, currently not possible: see bugs) attacks after the limit reached will be canceled. If the limit is set to 5, youâre able to make 1 attack as you normally do in every warzone game and pre-route 4 other attacks using the same armies. If you make one more pre-routed attack it will get canceled, leading that (if there are even more) attacks after the canceled attack wonât happen as you would imagine since you donât own the attacking territory at the time the order is happening.\n\nNote that when armies make a transfer they are completely stuck for the rest of the turn.

If you keep the option off every failed attack will freeze the remaining armies on the territory the attack was from, canceling all attacks / transfers from this territory.\n - The remaining checkboxes are for binding multi attack to a card or cards. Check the boxes of the corresponding cards you want, if you want multi attack to be bound to a card or cards.

Imagine some territories connected to each other. For simplicity weâll use the alphabet as their names. You own territory A, the other territories (B, C and D) are neutral. Your first order is to attack B from A. Your second order is a pre-routed transfer from B back to A. Thereafter you (multi) attack territories C and D starting from A. The order list would look like this:\n - ? armies from A will attack/transfer B\n - ? armies from B will attack/transfer A\n - ? armies from A will attack/transfer C\n - ? armies from C will attack/transfer D\n\n The first 2 orders will execute without any interferrence as its supposed to, but since the second order is a transfer it would freeze all the armies at A, so the 3 order would get skipped. Because of this the 4th order would also be skipped since we don't control C\n\n - (bugfix in review) Currently it is not yet possible to set the limit of multi attack to 0, although the UI does tell you it is. Trying to do this results in an alert telling you it is not possible, and even if the value goes through it gets overwritten to 1. If you want to have unlimited multi attacks (most usable in combination with enabling it with cards) you can set it to 100.000, which is technically infinite multi attacks";

The best part of these decoy cards are that the player itself can determine how many armies they will show. The mod will keep track of the actual army count on the territory and when the time is there, it will convert the territory back to what it was.\n\nWhen the turn advances you will need to control the territory you played a decoy on, otherwise the card will not get played (just like the emergency blockade card). Pick your territory therefore wisely, the card will get lost.\n\nWhen you deploy on a territory in decoy, the initial deployment order will get skipped. But donât worry, the armies will get added to actual army count stored by the mod. When a decoy card runs out, it will revert the army numbers to what is was before playing the card + the total number of armies deployed on the territory in decoy.\n\nObviously, you can use a decoy card to show you have way more armies than actually are on that territory. Some actions therefore are disabled for every territory in decoy. These actions are:\n - Attacking and transferring FROM a territory in decoy\n - Airlifting armies FROM a territory in decoy\nThese actions are disabled to make sure this mod is not exploitable, otherwise players could play a decoy card for millions of armies and use them. Not really the intention of this mod xD\n\nNote that although the decoy cards have a configurable duration (set by the game creator) it doesnât mean they always last this full duration. Some actions that meet a specific condition will trigger the card to run out, like using a blockade card on the territory. The following actions will trigger a decoy card to run out:\n - Attacking a territory in decoy\n - Transferring TO a territory in decoy\n - Airlifting TO a territory in decoy\n - Gifting a territory in decoy\n - Blockading a territory in decoy (both normal and emergencies blockades)\nThe most special case (and the most fun to watch) is when a territory in decoy gets attacked. The mod will show the initial attack, but then reverts the order back. It will then let the decoy card expire, resetting the army count to the actual armies. Thereafter, the attack will get played again, but now everyone who can see the attacking and defending territory will see the actual results of the attack.\n\nAll other cases above will expire the decoy card too.
