The Dead Watches...

Eliminated, surrendered and booted players will automatically play spy cards on every player and neutrals. They will be able to see the entire game from that point.

This mod takes full control over the spy card, doesn't matter if you've added the card or not. Players cannot get or play the card, only the dead players will automatically play them

Using this mod in combination of another mod that uses spy cards (Highest Income Disadvantage, Factions) is at your own risk
