Every player / team starts with a configurable amount of flags. These are indicated by the custom Flag unit, worth 0 armies! If a player / team loses to many flags it will be eliminated.
 - If you attack with a Flag, it can never get lost. But it will also have no effect when in a battle
 - The game creator can configure a cooldown to move Flag units around.
 - Capturing a Flag unit will create a different Flag unit. While you're in control of it, it might give you extra income (configurable)
 - The yellow-red Flag unit is the initial Flag unit. This flag has not been captured throughout the game.
 - The blue-green Flag unit is the same as the yellow-red Flag unit, with the only exception that it has been captured at least once.

Note that only the yellow-red Flag units count towards initial flags. You can lose as many blue-green Flag units as you like, but losing to many yellow-red flag Units means elimination!
