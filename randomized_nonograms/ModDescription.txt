[!] ONLY USE THIS MOD ON THE "Randomized nonogram map" (ID = 96671) [!]
This mod creates a random nonogram and will show the correct data of it in bonuslinks. Because there is no way you can add territies to bonuses by mods (at least I don't know them) this mod makes use of a recreated bonus system . 

Few notes:
Note that all the bonuses have the same territory, 400. There is a negative bonus that is equal to all other bonuses combined to make sure you're only getting income from the mod
With the custom distribution everyone will be able to see the answer because only territies in the answer are pickable
If the custom distribution is turned on, the distribution will always be manual. 
If the dimensions of the nonogram are bigger than 20 or smaller than 5 they will be modified to avoid a crash
I highly recommend to not play with a density lower than 60%! Else there will likely be more than 1 answer, meaning the puzzle is not solvable. 
Only exception for above is with the combination with custom distribution, which show the answer thus players don't have to solve the puzzle by themselves
The local deployments option will auto-deploy for everyone. It will increase the armies in every completed bonus by 1 (every territory in a bonus is part of 2 bonuses. So if you complete both bonuses for a territory it will be increased by 2)
Note that you'll have to manually turn on commerce if you disable custom local deployments, otherwise the mod can't give you extra income
Note that when the custom local deployments is not on you'll receive your extra income from bonuses in turn 0 (after the distribution) after turn 1
