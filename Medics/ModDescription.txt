A Medic is a special unit that recovers a configured percentage of armies from attacks. It uses the following rules:
 - A Medic will only recover armies on territories it borders
 - A Medic will only recover armies if it's stationary. If a Medic is part of the attack or forced to defend its territory, it cannot recover any armies
