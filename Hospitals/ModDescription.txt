Adds (configurable) hospitals to the game
!Recommended!
Don't use high percentages (above 50%) with a lot of hospitals! Play either with high percentages or with a lot of hospitals, not both!
Notes:
 - Minimum range = the territories directly connected to the territory with the hospital
 - Maximum range = the territories up to 5 territories away from the territory with the hospital (equal to the maximum range)
 - Its hard coded that only up to 25% of the remaining (neutral) territories can have a hospital
 - Its hard coded that the maximum range of the hospitals can be 5
