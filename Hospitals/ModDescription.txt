Hospitals are represented by the Hospital icon from Idle on the map. 
Hospitals are able to revive a percentage of lost armies in an attack / defence in the allowed radius.
Hospitals have a maximum range of 5 territories (This is already quite far...)

[!]note[!]
Be careful with this mod. It is very easy to create a scenario where income is inevitable due to the Hospitals reviving all armies back and generating more.
Idealy you want to have a scenario where a party cannot get 100% of their lost armies back when attacking any territory.
To help with this the mod will at most distribute 1/4 of the map with Hospitals.
