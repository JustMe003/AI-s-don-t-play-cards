Citizens of any territory do not like to have a different leader. But the longer they have the same leader, the more they will contribute to the society

This mod adds 3 new rules:
 - Every territory has a number (multiplier) which will affect every bonus value the territory belongs to
 - When a territory has a different owner at the end of the turn then at the start of the turn, this multiplier is reset to the lowest value
 - Every time a territory has the same owner at the end of the turn as at the start of the turn, this multiplier is increased (until the maximum value is reached)

This mod is compatible with Local Deployment
